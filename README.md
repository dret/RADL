RADL
====

RESTful API Description Language (RADL) is an XML vocabulary for
describing Hypermedia-driven RESTful APIs. The APIs it describes may
use any media type, in XML, JSON, HTML, or any other format. The
structure of a RADL description is based on media types, including the
documents associated with a media type, links found in these
documents, and the interfaces associated with these links.

RADL can be used as a specification language or as run-time metadata
to describe a service.  A JSON representation of RADL is under
development.
