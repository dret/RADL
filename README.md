RADL
====

RESTful API Description Language (RADL) is an XML vocabulary for
describing Hypermedia-driven RESTful APIs. Unlike most REST
description languages, RADL takes a purist approach to REST. The
structure of a RADL description is based on media types, including the
documents associated with a media type, links found in these
documents, and the interfaces associated with these links. The APIs it
describes may use any media type, in XML, JSON, HTML, or any other
format.

RADL can be used as a specification language or as run-time metadata
to describe a service.  A JSON representation of RADL is under
development.

See spec/RADL.html for documentation.
